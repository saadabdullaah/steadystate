# Engineering Log

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 0 foundation

### Done

- Established Windows Git and PowerShell as the primary local workflow.
- Protected private planning material from Git tracking.
- Selected a maintained Gateway API implementation after validating dependency lifecycle.
- Defined pinned tools, cluster profiles, CI gates, and failure diagnostics.
- Enabled protected-branch governance, security scanning, dependency updates, and immutable required checks.
- Proved the minimal profile and all required quality, security, Windows, CodeQL, and cluster checks in GitHub Actions.

### Next

- Begin Phase 1 API and controller design on top of the validated foundation.

## 2026-07-13 — Standard-profile topology correction

### Done

- Pinned Envoy Gateway data-plane pods to the kind node that owns the host-port mappings.
- Preserved cross-node service routing with `externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster`.
- Revalidated the complete required-check suite in GitHub Actions.
- Proved a standard-profile bootstrap, destroy, clean re-bootstrap, and final idempotent cleanup.

## 2026-07-13 — Windows acceptance

### Done

- Validated Docker Engine 29.6.1 with Linux containers and cgroup v2 through `doctor`.
- Completed a cold standard-profile bootstrap locally in 8.9 minutes.
- Reproved Gateway API ingress and Calico NetworkPolicy enforcement on Windows.
- Hardened the positive-connectivity proof against transient Service endpoint programming.
- Converged the existing cluster in 1.2 minutes, then proved destroy is safe both when present and absent.
