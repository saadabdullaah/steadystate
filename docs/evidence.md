# Hosted Evidence Contracts

Every hosted acceptance artifact is revision-bound and must contain schema-versioned JSON, generated/rendered state, success or failure diagnostics captured before cleanup, and the phase's real VHS recording where required. Missing required files fail the workflow.

Phase 5 uploads `phase5-acceptance-<commit>` with:

- `phase5-request-telemetry.gif` and its tracked tape;
- `evidence.json` and the incremental `state.json`;
- Grafana Prometheus/Loki/Tempo datasource health responses;
- correlated Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo query results for one request/trace identity;
- Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana fast-burn alert results;
- memory working-set measurements;
- rendered GitOps platform state and Kubernetes/Argo snapshots;
- operator, Alloy, OTel Collector, Loki, and Tempo logs;
- cluster diagnostics from the common diagnostics contract.

The Phase 5 schema is version `1`. It records the exact source SHA, profile, result/failure, timestamps, named elapsed checks, request/trace identity, and memory values. The workflow validates these fields before upload and runs failure capture before unconditional GitOps/cluster cleanup.
